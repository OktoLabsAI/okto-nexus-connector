# CLI usage guide

## Choose the task

| Task | Command | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Check address/version | `reach --server URL` | Public HTTP probe, no key required |
| First guided connection | `connect --server URL --agent AGENT` | Imports key and guides remote runtime setup |
| Configure with an imported identity or JSON | `configure --identity ALIAS` | Interactive wizard on this computer by default |
| See actual connection progress | `status` | Queries server and daemon |
| Inspect failures | `logs --errors`, `doctor --probe` | Local logs and diagnostic probes |
| Keep the daemon running | `daemon start`, `service install` | Background process / user autostart |
| Run a turn explicitly | `runtime start`, `runtime submit` | Requires an approved binding and execution authorization |
| Start over locally | `clean` | Confirmed local reset; server records remain |

See the [complete syntax reference](cli-reference.md) for every flag, including advanced and legacy commands.

## Names, keys and IDs

| Value | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Agent ID | Canonical identity on Nexus | `claude-coder` |
| Agent key | Secret authenticating that identity; obtain from Nexus | Enter at hidden prompt |
| Identity alias | Local name for an imported key/server pair; used by `--identity` | `assistant` |
| Connection alias | Local name of a configured binding; used by runtime commands | `claude` |
| Connector ID | Persistent local machine registration identity | Returned by diagnostics |
| Executor ID | Server-side registration of the execution host | Returned by `executor register/list` |
| Request/client intent ID | Stable identifier used to resume the same request | Printed by the wizard |
| Session ID | A runtime conversation, not an agent or binding | Returned by runtime status/start |

`--agent` checks a name against the key; it does not authenticate by itself. `--identity` selects a stored identity alias, not a raw key. Do not place keys in URLs or command arguments. Machine approvals use the registered Connector ID, not IP or hostname. Clearing state creates a new machine ID.

## Global options and shells

```sh
okto-nexus-connector --help
okto-nexus-connector configure --help
okto-nexus-connector --json status
okto-nexus-connector --state-dir /absolute/connector-state status
```

Global flags must precede the command. Quote paths with spaces. Examples use single-line commands compatible with ordinary POSIX shells and PowerShell; replace example addresses, aliases, IDs and paths. Do not type placeholder names literally. `configure` and `connect` are interactive; `configure` rejects JSON/non-interactive mode, and `connect` rejects non-interactive mode. Do not use interactive wizards as unattended scripts.

JSON status contains `connections` and is useful for automation. Exit code 0 indicates the command completed, not necessarily that every connection is online; inspect result/status fields. Exit codes: 1 application error, 2 usage/interruption, 3 daemon/executor unavailable, 4 uncertain outcome. Streaming JSON output uses one record per line where supported.

## Import and maintain identity

```sh
okto-nexus-connector identity add --server https://nexus.example.com --agent claude-coder --alias assistant
okto-nexus-connector identity list
okto-nexus-connector identity show assistant
okto-nexus-connector identity replace-credential assistant
```

`add` and credential replacement read a hidden prompt by default. Automation can use `--credential-stdin` or `--credential-env VARIABLE_NAME`; the variable must already be securely populated. `connect` additionally supports explicit MCP-entry import with `--mcp-entry` and `--mcp-entry-name`.

The OS keyring is preferred. Restricted-file fallback requires explicit consent and stores permission-restricted plaintext. `identity remove ALIAS` removes local identity material; it does not revoke the canonical key on Nexus. Credential replacement must authenticate as the same agent.

## Configure and approve

Follow [the connection guide](connection-configuration.md). Normal Connector setup needs the target agent key, not an operator key. The operator approves in Nexus. The daemon completes current submitted requests asynchronously; the wizard prints a request ID for recovery. A pending approval is not a usable binding.

Nexus **Remote machine policy** controls a second machine requesting the same agent: manual replacement approval (default), automatic denial, or automatic acceptance with revocation of the previous machine. Automatic replacement retains approved preferences and remaining authorization limits; it is not a fresh unlimited grant.

Model/reasoning/native approval preferences belong to the harness. Nexus tool access and execution authorization are separate. Selecting automatic native approval does not waive Nexus authorization. See [harness settings](harness-configuration.md).

## Daily operation

```sh
okto-nexus-connector status --agent claude-coder
okto-nexus-connector logs --tail 100
okto-nexus-connector logs --follow
okto-nexus-connector doctor --probe
okto-nexus-connector daemon status
okto-nexus-connector service install --dry-run
okto-nexus-connector service install
okto-nexus-connector service status
```

`daemon start` starts detached; `daemon run` owns the foreground until stopped. `daemon stop` drains/stops the daemon. `service uninstall` disables the OS autostart registration. The service uses the selected state directory and OS account; inspect its plan for logout/boot behavior. A running process is not proof of a live server connection.

## Runtime sessions

Use the acknowledged connection alias and returned IDs:

```sh
okto-nexus-connector runtime start claude --client-intent-id open-1 --text "Reply with Ready."
okto-nexus-connector runtime status --alias claude
okto-nexus-connector runtime inspect SESSION_ID --alias claude
okto-nexus-connector runtime submit SESSION_ID "Summarize your last response." --alias claude --client-intent-id turn-1
okto-nexus-connector runtime operation --alias claude --client-intent-id turn-1
okto-nexus-connector runtime interrupt SESSION_ID --alias claude --client-intent-id interrupt-1 --current-run
okto-nexus-connector runtime stop SESSION_ID --alias claude --client-intent-id close-1 --reason "Work completed"
```

Admission is not completion; query the operation for its result. Reuse the same intent only to recover the exact same request. Use a new ID for intentional new work. `--new-session` explicitly requests a new compatible conversation. `steer` and interrupt targeting depend on native adapter support; inspect `--help` for `--expected-turn-id` versus `--current-run`.

`runtime logs SESSION_ID` is a legacy stream surface, not a complete R4 event viewer. Use canonical operation/session status and Nexus execution logs for R4. Automatic Nexus delivery does not require manually starting a session for every message.

## Proxy and transport

```sh
okto-nexus-connector proxy set --url http://proxy.example.com:8080 --no-proxy ".internal.example.com"
okto-nexus-connector proxy show
okto-nexus-connector proxy set --url-env NEXUS_PROXY_URL
okto-nexus-connector proxy set --direct
okto-nexus-connector proxy clear
```

For authentication, securely populate `NEXUS_PROXY_URL` with the URL-encoded proxy URL first. Only its variable name is saved; the daemon/service must receive the variable too. A missing configured variable fails rather than silently connecting directly. Restart the daemon after changing proxy settings/environment.

Without saved configuration, proxy discovery uses HTTPS_PROXY for HTTPS/WSS, HTTP_PROXY for HTTP/WS, then ALL_PROXY. NO_PROXY or `--no-proxy` accepts hosts, domain suffixes, host:port entries or `*`. Loopback bypasses proxies. HTTP(S) proxies and Basic authentication are supported; SOCKS/NTLM are not. Corporate CA roots can use SSL_CERT_FILE/SSL_CERT_DIR. TLS verification remains enabled.

Nexus global transport policy decides whether HTTP/WS is allowed or HTTPS/WSS is mandatory. Provider API/MCP traffic uses the harness's network settings; Connector proxy configuration covers Connector-to-Nexus traffic and is not exported in portable JSON.

## Advanced R4 automation

The wizard is recommended. Explicit commands expose individual steps for tooling; registering an executor alone does not authorize runtime execution. Obtain each ID/revision/digest from the preceding response, not from example text.

1. Import identity using a protected source, then `executor register --identity ALIAS --label HOST_LABEL`.
2. Use `executor configure-discovery --server-id SERVER_ID --harness-root ABSOLUTE_DIRECTORY` as needed; this replaces configured discovery roots, not the system PATH. `discover --server-id SERVER_ID --verbose` shows candidates.
3. Run `executor probe` with the selected harness, candidate ref and inventory revision.
4. Stage consent using `executor configure-launch --identity ALIAS --harness ADAPTER --local-consent-id CONSENT_ID --profile-revision 1`, optionally selecting provider home/secret references.
5. Start the daemon. Publish `executor realize` with the same identity, adapter, candidate, inventory revision, configuration digest and an explicit project/label. Retain the returned realization reference.
6. `bind prepare --identity ALIAS --realization-ref REF --alias CONNECTION --client-intent-id PREPARE_ID`; review the exact diff and obtain required operator approval.
7. `bind apply --identity ALIAS --prepare-intent-id PREPARE_ID --client-intent-id APPLY_ID --approved-diff-hash HASH --operator-proof-ref APPROVAL_REF` when a proof is required.

These low-level binding commands do not include the wizard's complete configuration/authorization bundle. Execution may still require operator configuration and a valid grant in Nexus. Do not equate a binding acknowledgment with permission to run. Use [the syntax reference](cli-reference.md) for all required realization/probe flags.

## Compatibility command boundaries

`bind create/list/show/remove` manage the older local binding surface; they are not the canonical R4 prepare/apply workflow. `approvals list/decide` is a daemon-mediated HITL surface, not a way for an agent key to approve its own remote access; use Nexus Approvals for onboarding. `mcp-config plan/apply/remove` manages selected direct-HTTP client configuration, not a Connector MCP server. It requires an explicit server-issued capability reference and supported client format; Pi uses its native tools bridge. Preserve ownership/CAS checks when changing existing client files.

## Clean reset

```sh
okto-nexus-connector clean
okto-nexus-connector --non-interactive clean --yes
```

The interactive default is No. See [cleanup scope and recovery cautions](runbook.md#reset-abandoned-local-configuration) before confirming. The command is local and does not cancel/revoke records in Nexus. For a transient network failure, use diagnostics and resume the original request instead.
